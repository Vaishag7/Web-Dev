        <p>
            I am a second year undergraduate in the department of Chemical engineering at IIT Bombay. I hail from the city of dreams, the 'Shiksha ki Kashi', Kota Rajasthan. 
        <br>
        The most important pillar of my life is my spirituality. All my times, whether good or bad, happy or sad; spirituality is something which has always been there with me.
